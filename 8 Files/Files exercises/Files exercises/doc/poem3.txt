The silence, the worst sound that exists. 
The sorrow, the pain that never subsides. 
The fear, that you deviate from the ideal. 
But music breaks through all of that!

My emotions are beautifully described. 
Something that music does fantastically. 
I really can’t live without it. Music is in my blood.

More than a rhythm, more than a melody. 
The most beautiful lyrics come from my MP3. 
Music will never disappear, if you believe in it. 
There is always a tune, that tune in your head.
