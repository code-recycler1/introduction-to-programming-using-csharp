The sweetest grandma, that’s you, 
You always make me happy too! 
And even if it’s cold outside, 
There’s always that warmth that says you love me inside! 
I want to thank you for that, 
We can laugh and cry together, no matter what. 
Grandma, I love you so, 
Even in this winter’s snow! 
Of course, I’ll congratulate you, 
While we spy on the dessert too. 
Whenever you’re around, 
Everything has a happy end, I’ve found. 
So… GRANDMA, CONGRATULATIONS, 
I know your kindness and care will never end!
