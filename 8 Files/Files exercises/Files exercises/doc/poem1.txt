Once a humble spud, 
In the ground so snug, 
Dreamed of being more, 
Than just a simple spore.

“Is this my fate?” 
The potato pondered late, 
“To be mashed or fried, 
Or in a stew to hide?”

But then it had a thought, 
A dream it dearly sought, 
To be a golden chip, 
On someone’s eager lip.

So it took a leap, 
From the soil so deep, 
And into the fryer it went, 
With a crispy, golden scent.

Now it sits with pride, 
On a plate, side by side, 
With burgers and fries, 
A dream realized.
