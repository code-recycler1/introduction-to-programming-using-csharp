A room full of teachers and friends where everyone feels good within. 
The laughter, the atmosphere, a feeling that never disappears.

In each of you I find something great. 
You are friends I can rely on, laugh and talk with. 
I can and will never forget you, never leave you.

After the vacation, I saw you again. 
When I read everyone’s thoughts, 
You mean too much to me, we are an amazing class!
