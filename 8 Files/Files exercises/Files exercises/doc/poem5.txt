Sorry for everything, for what I have done. 
Sorry that I left you, standing there alone.

Sorry for everything, sorry for all the pain. 
Sorry, I know it, even if you can’t see it.

Sorry for everything, it’s me again, interfering. 
But still, I hope that for you, a sun will bloom again.

Sorry for everything, forgive me the most, 
Sorry that I ever, was there at all.
