## Exercise 6

To find someone's ideal body weight (only for adults), use the following formula:
    M = (L + 4 * P - 100) / 2

Where:  
- `M` = body weight in kg  
- `L` = height in cm  
- `P` = wrist circumference in cm

Write the program that reads the height and wrist circumference, then prints the ideal body weight.
